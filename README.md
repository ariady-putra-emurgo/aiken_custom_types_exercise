# aiken_custom_types_exercise

Your goal is to FIX the following types:

- `Person`
- `LogLevel`
- `Team`

They're all located at [`./lib/custom/types.ak`](./lib/custom/types.ak)

After you fix them, feel free to play around.
Instantiate the types, access their fields (by named-accessor, destructuring, or pattern-matching),
and update the values (See: https://aiken-lang.org/language-tour/custom-types#updating-custom-types)
